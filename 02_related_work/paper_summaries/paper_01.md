## Problem

The study addresses the problem of controlling exam question difficulty, psychometric calibration, and cognitive alignment in automated question generation (AQG) systems. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and conventional RAG frameworks (such as GraphRAG, HippoRAG, LightRAG) improve information accuracy, they lack a systematic mechanism to control cognitive difficulty levels (e.g., according to Bloom's Taxonomy) and psychometric validity (e.g., according to Item Response Theory - IRT), which are crucial for standardized assessment exams.

## Method

### Research Methodology
This study uses a mixed experimental approach combining a human benchmarking study — where real participants divided into difficulty groups took system-generated and official ACT exam questions — and a simulation study with 5,000 virtual test-takers modeled using the 3PL IRT model. Results are compared against official ACT exam questions as a control group to validate difficulty calibration.

### Technical Method
The proposed framework, named **KAQG (Knowledge Augmented Question Generation)**, integrates Item Response Theory (IRT), Bloom's Taxonomy, and Knowledge Graphs (KG) into a distributed multi-agent RAG system. Key features include:
1. **Multi-Graph Isolation:** Each course subject is supported by an independent knowledge graph to eliminate cross-domain terminological noise.
2. **PageRank-based Concept Weighting:** Ranks and selects core learning concepts in the KG using the PageRank algorithm to ensure questions cover the curriculum focus.
3. **IRT 3PL Parameter Calibration:** Maps graph and cognitive attributes to the 3-parameter logistic (3PL) IRT model:
   - Difficulty parameter ($b$): Correlates with graph depth and higher Bloom's cognitive levels (e.g., Analyze, Evaluate).
   - Discrimination parameter ($a$): Correlates with the node degree of concept nodes in the graph.
   - Guessing parameter ($c$): Minimized via multi-hop reasoning on the knowledge graph to generate plausible distractors.
4. **Question Surface Feature Evaluation:** Assesses difficulty based on a combination of 7 MCQ features (stem length, domain vocabulary, cognitive demand, option length, option similarity, stem-option overlap, distractor plausibility) to calculate a generalized difficulty score.
5. **Distributed Multi-Agent Architecture:** Coordinates specialized agents (Retriever, Generator, Evaluator) over Data Distribution Service (DDS) using a publish-subscribe model to improve throughput and fault tolerance.

## Dataset

- The system utilizes a knowledge base built from **102 textbook PDFs** and learning materials.
- For comparative evaluation, the researchers used **3 reading passages from the official ACT Reading exam** (Passage A, B, C) with 10 official questions each as the control group.

## Evaluation

The study uses two complementary evaluation processes:
1. **Human Benchmarking:** Recruited participants divided into 4 groups to take exams consisting of official ACT questions (control) and 3 groups of system-generated questions at Low, Medium, and High difficulty levels. Measured metrics include the correct answer rate (P-value / Difficulty), discrimination index, and expert ratings on question quality (5-point Likert scale).
2. **Simulation Study:** Simulated 5,000 virtual test-takers with ability $\theta_i \sim N(0,1)$. Used the 3PL model to generate response matrices for 90 questions (evenly split across 3 difficulty levels). Applied IRT estimation to compare recovered parameters with the true parameters. Conducted ablation studies on 5 different conditions (Full, -IRT, -Bloom, -IRT&Bloom, Baseline-RAG).

## Results

1. **Human Benchmarking:** The system exhibits stable difficulty control. The Low group has the highest average correct rate ($P = 0.82 \pm 0.06$), the Medium group ($P = 0.71 \pm 0.07$) is similar to the official ACT ($P = 0.76 \pm 0.05$), and the High group has the highest difficulty ($P = 0.63 \pm 0.08$). The discrimination index remains stable ($0.32 - 0.37$), proving the system alters difficulty without losing the ability to distinguish student abilities.
2. **Simulation Study:** The Full model recovers parameters with a very high correlation to the ground-truth for difficulty $b$ (correlation coefficient $0.91$, RMSE $0.22$) and discrimination $a$ ($0.82$). The difficulty misclassification rate is only $6.7\%$, significantly outperforming conditions lacking IRT/Bloom (error rates ranging from $12.5\%$ to $27.8\%$).

## Limitations

- **System Complexity:** Setting up knowledge graphs and the multi-agent system combined with the DDS communication protocol requires substantial computing resources and complex engineering, making it difficult to integrate directly into lightweight LMS platforms.
- **Initial Expert Dependence:** The weights of the 7 surface difficulty features still rely on subjective expert evaluation and have not been fully optimized using large-scale empirical data from real users.
- **Extraction Noise:** Extracting entities and relationships from scanned or blurry PDF textbooks is prone to errors, requiring additional entity normalization post-processing.

## Relevance to our topic

This paper is relevant to our requirements engineering focus in two ways. First, it reveals that cognitive alignment with Bloom's Taxonomy is treated as an internal system parameter rather than an instructor-selectable requirement tied to specific CLOs — confirming the absence of formally specified functional requirements for CLO selection and question tagging in existing systems. Second, the deployment complexity limitation directly motivates the need for non-functional requirements specifying infrastructure and response time constraints for LMS integration. The reliance on expert-defined difficulty weights also highlights the need for formally specified instructor input requirements in any CLO-aligned quiz generation system.

## Possible Improvement

- **System Simplification:** Remove the complex DDS mechanism and replace it with a sequential RAG workflow integrated directly into the LMS API to optimize response time.
- **Add Explanations for Wrong Answers:** Add a module to automatically generate detailed feedback for incorrect choices (distractor feedback) based on semantic relations in the knowledge graph to support student self-study.
